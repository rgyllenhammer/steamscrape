# steamscrape
A webscraper made with beautiful soup to scrape the steam sales section

This is just for a proof of concept... This is literally no different from the page Steam has. Maybe you could argue that it is faster to check because you don't have to type in the steam url, but seriously, this is just to prove to myself that I can scrape websites

dont h8 me cuz u 8nt me. This is some seriously RAWWWWW stuff bro

ps to myself... stop doing things like that ^^^ future companies are probably not going to like ur readmes full of spicy commentary. 

psps to myself... u r a biatch dude chill u will just make a new github before they hire u or just change the readme stop stressing.
