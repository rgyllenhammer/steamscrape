# steamscrape
A webscraper made with beautiful soup to scrape the steam sales section

This is just for a proof of concept... This is literally no different from the page Steam has. Maybe you could argue that it is faster to check because you don't have to type in the steam url, but seriously, this is just to prove to myself that I can scrape websites
